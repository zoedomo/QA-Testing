# QA-Testing
**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

To guarantee the functionality and security of my code, I used JUnit tests to cover various scenarios, ensuring that both valid and invalid inputs are examined. Secure coding practices such as input validation and output encoding can be added to stop any vulnerabilities.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

By engaging with stakeholders and users, we gain insights into their needs and expectations. These insights are translated into clear user stories, made from the userâ€™s feedback. This approach ensures that user requirements are successfully incorporated, aligning the program closely with user needs.

**How do I approach designing software?**

My software design approach includes breaking down complex problems into modular components. I prioritize clear interfaces and responsibilities for each module, enhancing maintainability.
